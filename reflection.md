## Reflection Document

### HTML

Working on the HTML exercises gave me a solid understanding of how elements build the structure of a web page. I learned how lists help organize content, how images are added with appropriate alt text for accessibility, and how tables structure data using rows and cells. Forms were especially engaging, teaching me how to collect user input with various elements, which made the page feel more interactive and functional.

### Accessibility

In the accessibility exercises, I focused on improving the usability of a starter HTML form, especially for users with screen readers or assistive technology. Using tools like WAVE and Lighthouse, I identified and fixed issues like missing labels and poor contrast. This process helped me understand the importance of semantic HTML and making sure every form element is accessible and clearly labeled.

### CSS

The CSS section helped me understand how styling and layout impact web design. I learned how selectors and specificity determine which styles apply, and how pseudo-classes like :hover add interactivity. I explored layout techniques including positioning, Flexbox, and Grid. Flexbox made it easier to align and distribute space, while Grid allowed me to build two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. Media queries showed me how to create responsive designs for various screen sizes. Learning Bootstrap demonstrated how pre-built classes can speed up styling and layout, especially for responsiveness and UI components, reducing the need to write repetitive CSS.
